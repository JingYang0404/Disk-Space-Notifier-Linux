# Disk-Threshold-Notifier-Linux-
A simple Linux tool that sends email notifications when a disk threshold is reached. The novelty of this small project is that it uses python language mixed with linux commands instead of typical linux script. 

If designated threshold is reached, terminal will output "OH NO!!! Disk space is critically low!", and notify said user through an email.
If not, terminal will output "Disk space is sufficient."
